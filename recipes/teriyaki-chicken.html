    alt="Some delicious teriyaki chicken">
            <p>in Japanese cuisine, foods grilled with a highly flavoured glaze of soy sauce and sake or mirin (sweet wine). Garlic and fresh ginger are sometimes added to the mixture.\
                 In westernized Japanese cooking, the teriyaki sauce is frequently used as a marinade as well as a basting sauce.</p>
            <p>This is my <strong>favorite</strong> dish because its not too bad for you and the 
            taste is amazing.</p>
